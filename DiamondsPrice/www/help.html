      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This application allows you to check if the value of a diamods is adjusted to the value in the market
       You just need to set up the Quality of the cut, the caret and the price
       And you will be able to see the adjusted prices for that quality
       The mean price for caret of diamonds cutted with the same quality (in a red line)
       And a Blue point with the indication of the price and carets of your diamond, that you have updated on the slidebars on the left
       Finally, you will see if, according to the model, your diamond is too cheap, too expensive or it is adjusted to the regular market price.</p>
      <h3>Input</h3>
      <p>There are three inputs on the left side panel, the Cut Quality, and the slidebars to set the price and caret</p>
      <h3>Output</h3>
      <p>On the main panel it can be seen a plot showing the prices of different carets depending on the cut quality selected,
           The mean price for caret of diamonds cutted with the same quality is displayed in a red line.
           And a Blue point is the indication of the price vs carets of your diamond.
           Under the plot it is labelled if the price is too cheap, too expensive or normal in the market
